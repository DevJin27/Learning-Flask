# Learning Flask â€“ No Excuses! ðŸš€  

Well... this is an **inconsistent** B.Tech student finally committing to **learning Flask consistently!**  

But unlike my previous projects, **this time, NO EXCUSES!**  
I'm determined to **learn Flask to its core** and ensure **no laziness and no shortcuts!**  

I'll be following **Miguel Grinberg's _The Flask Mega-Tutorial_**  
(available at [miguelgrinberg.com](https://miguelgrinberg.com)).  

To keep myself accountable, I'm opting for an **open learning / build-in-public approach.**  

Stay tuned for progress updates! ðŸ”¥
